                        I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at BIT Mesra, where I am developing a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. Passionate about technology and innovation, I have a keen interest in areas such as web development.
I enjoy tackling complex problems and continuously strive to expand my skill set through both academic projects and personal coding endeavors. My goal is to gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge technologies and contribute to impactful projects that leverage technology to solve real-world challenges.
